          Who is responsible? 

          Why did the failure occur? 

          Was it a design flaw or deficiency? 

          Was it due to poor construction or improper materials?
           Is the structure safe, salvageable or does it need to be levelled?

          If you have a building performance or structural issue, let the
          professionals at Incode Engineers help you.

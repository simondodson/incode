If a material, component, or structure fails, we work laboriously to find out why. Who is responsible? Why did the failure occur? Was it a design flaw or deficiency? Was it due to poor construction or improper materials? Is the structure safe, salvageable or does it need to be levelled?

If you have a building performance or structural issue, let the professionals at Incode Engineers help you. Our litigation experience has frequently involved determining what caused a particular failure, which ultimately can help determine the responsible parties. We employ structural engineering analyses and field-testing techniques, which combine with our prior experiences to help us determine the causes of failures or problems.

Our Forensic Engineering professionals investigate materials and structures that fail or do not operate as intended, and our investigative and forensic engineering services are available to insurers, property managers, risk managers, builders, and homeowners. Incode Engineers work closely with building owners, insurance companies, contractors, and attorneys to investigate such structures. We follow a rigorous forensic engineering approach to determine the cause or causes of failure.

Our analysis can focus on one of two approaches: to repair or improve the performance, or to assist a court in determining the facts of the failure.

Forensic engineering projects must begin with the collection of data related to the material or component that failed. Our team utilises inspections, measurement surveys, computer models, experiments, or other types of evidence collection. Throughout the investigation process, we work respectfully with the many other parties that are involved. As the investigation evolves, we communicate our conclusions clearly and objectively.

We draw on our many years of experience to provide high-quality assistance to the insurance industry in claims handling. We know the right questions to ask, and we obtain information thoroughly to ensure the most accurate answers are found. We also provide expert witness testimony for the legal profession as part of our services.

We answer these questions using the following methods:

- Careful photographic documentation
- Precise measurements and field notes
- Inclusion of witness interviews and review of information about the site
- Review of construction drawings, building-department files, geotechnical reports
- This process leaves our forensic engineers with one or more plausible hypotheses and enough information to determine what caused the loss event. Once the main cause of the failure is understood, the full extent and severity of the damage can be assessed and repair options evaluated.

Our forensic engineers are experienced and well versed in cases where there are conflicting views about how a loss event occurred. As well as establishing the cause of a loss event, Incode Engineers are also able to resolve issues that may arise in the technical and engineering fields. These issues may include laws related to the insurance policy or contract that applies to the loss incident in question.
